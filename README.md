# VSCRunner
This is an application created for my school to save and load Visual Studio Code extensions, as the school computers reset after each restart.

This project started as a batch script made by another student in my class and was expanded upon by me before being converted to a C# program due to the advantages it provided.

## Features
- Save and load VS Code settings.
- Save and load VS Code extensions.
- Output VS Code logs and error messages in a console window.

## Planned Features
- Multi-threading to improve loading times.
- Dynamic directory paths, as they are currently hardcoded for our school's system.
